# heroku

`dentarg/heroku` is an [composite run steps action] that deploys your app to Heroku, by `git push`.

The Heroku API key (`HEROKU_API_KEY`) needs to be saved as a [secret in GitHub Actions]. Use [`heroku authorizations`] to generate the API key, see this [Heroku help article] for more information.

If you pass `github-token`, the action will create [deployments] in your repository. When you use this, the workflow needs not to be triggered by the [`push` event] to work. See the example below.

The example workflow below deploys the app when the `CI` workflow ran succesfully against the default branch.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Heroku

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [CI]
    types: [completed]

permissions:
  contents: read
  deployments: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    if: |
      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' &&
      github.event.workflow_run.head_branch == github.event.repository.default_branch
    concurrency: myapp
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dentarg/heroku@v1
        with:
          app: myapp
          key: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}
          sha: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_commit.id }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
